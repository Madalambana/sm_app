Title: SM_App(Social Media Application)

Description: This is an API based on the first API I built. The whole purpose of this is to
    create a social media application for the students of the University I am currently attending
    seeing that the students are heavily dependent on Facebook despite Facebook not being attended
    to my some students and significant stakeholders of the institution. It is futile that 
    complaints and queries are written and upload there whereas this app could universally connect
    people who have the privellages of taking action and the people in need of rescue. This is API
    is still under construction as it still requires a front-end interface and feedback from the 
    stakeholders who will use the application. The application also needs a few touch ups and minor
    bugs that need addressing but will be able to work with

Credits: The creation of this application was inspired by the dilemma at the instition along with
    the advice of a fellow programmer (Masbulele Madikizela) as he also added points as to how the 
    application should behave.
